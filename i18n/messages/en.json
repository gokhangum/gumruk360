    "body_html": "<p>Customs and foreign trade involve constantly updated regulations, document flows, and time pressure. Traditional methods can be slow, hard to track, and costly. Easycustoms360 is a Customs Consultancy Service Platform built on the infrastructure of Consphera Technology & Consultancy, which unites engineering, consulting, and artificial intelligence.</p>\n<p>Our aim is to combine technology with customs expertise to make access to the expertise required for foreign trade and customs processes fast, expert-driven, transparent, and traceable.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, our in-house Consphera PSA (Professional Services Automation) backbone automates—end to end—intake, pre-assessment, risk scoring, AI-assisted instant pricing, SLA management, expert selection, quality control, invoicing, and reporting, making the consultancy flow traceable from first contact to delivery.</p>\n<h2>What We Do with Easycustoms360</h2>\n<ul><li>Simplifying complex regulation with expertise: making problem areas understandable through expert analysis and offering applicable solutions.</li><li>Standardizing speed: instant offers, response times, real-time notifications, and tracking screens for predictable service.</li><li>Trust through expertise: the ability to choose a topic-specific expert and two-stage quality control.</li><li>Cost and flexibility: per-question or credit-based model; one-off payments and subscription scenarios.</li><li>Traceability and compliance: all processes are recorded and comply with GDPR principles; data security strengthened with role-based access and encryption.</li></ul>\n<h2>Vision</h2>\n<p>To digitize foreign trade and customs consultancy; to standardize speed, accuracy, and trust in one package; to become a globally referenced “new norm” for regulation-based consultancy—supported by a scalable architecture, measurable SLAs, and continuous improvement.</p>\n<h2>Our Values</h2>\n<ul><li>Trust: Accurate information, clear contracts, traceable process.</li><li>Competence: Expert team, continuous training, and up-to-date legislation tracking.</li><li>Speed: Short response times, effective automation, smart prioritization.</li><li>Privacy & Compliance: Data processing aligned with GDPR principles and standards.</li><li>Continuous Improvement: A product that evolves with user feedback; we track performance/experience metrics every release and deliver visible improvements.</li></ul>\n<h2>Our Founder</h2>\n<p>Our founder, Gökhan Yurdakul, spent the first ten years of his career at the Republic of Türkiye Ministry of Trade, playing an active role in drafting both legislation and the regulations that guide implementation. He then joined PwC Türkiye, and over the next ten years he blended his public-sector experience with the private sector’s needs—identifying requirements and delivering practical, applicable solutions. </p><p>Recognizing that customs and foreign trade processes require continuous improvement, and that rapid access to information on current or planned matters can significantly increase the value created—while traditional methods fall short in this respect—he founded EasyCustoms360.com.</p>"
